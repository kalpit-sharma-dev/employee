When upgrading from Go 1.22.2 to Go 1.23.3, there are several new features and changes you should be aware of, some of which may potentially impact your service:

### New Features and Changes
1. **`for-range` Enhancements**:
   The `range` clause now supports iterator functions with types such as `func(func() bool)` and similar. This might require changes if your code uses custom iterator functions.

2. **New Packages and Functions**:
   - The `slices` package introduces functions like `Sorted`, `AppendSeq`, and `Collect`, among others.
   - The `maps` package adds `Insert`, `Collect`, and other utility functions.
   - A new `structs` package allows for advanced struct field manipulations.
   - New `unique` and `iter` packages have been added.

3. **Toolchain Changes**:
   - `GOROOT_FINAL` environment variable is no longer supported.
   - The `go list -m -json` command now includes new fields (`Sum`, `GoModSum`).

4. **Runtime and Garbage Collection**:
   - `time.Timer` and `time.Ticker` objects not referenced by the program are now garbage-collected more aggressively.
   - The associated timer channel is now unbuffered, potentially affecting timing-related logic.

5. **`go vet` Improvements**:
   - It now flags symbols that are incompatible with the targeted Go version.

6. **Go Modules**:
   - New support for the `godebug` directive in `go.mod` files for debugging purposes.
   - `go mod tidy` now supports a `-diff` flag for better insight into changes.

### Potential Breaking Changes
- Code relying on `GOROOT_FINAL` might need adjustments.
- Applications using timers and tickers should be reviewed to ensure compatibility with the new garbage collection behavior.
- Any custom tooling or scripts using `go list` might need updates to account for new JSON fields.
- `go vet` may introduce stricter validations, which could flag previously unnoticed issues.

### Recommendations
1. **Run Tests**:
   Ensure you have a robust test suite to catch issues caused by runtime or toolchain changes.
   
2. **Code Review**:
   Review usage of `time.Timer`, `time.Ticker`, and any related channels to adapt to the unbuffered nature.

3. **Static Analysis**:
   Use `go vet` and other tools with the new Go version to identify potential code issues early.

4. **Check Dependencies**:
   Update and validate third-party dependencies to ensure compatibility with Go 1.23.3.
